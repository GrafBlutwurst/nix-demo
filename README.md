# Nix Demo

This README contains just a very terse summary of my presentation.

## Setting up a flake 

`nix flake init` will generate a simple flake. To use flakes you need to be in a Git Repo. Flakes also only consider files that are tracked by git.

## Use nix-flake-utils

It's an excellent library that makes common things in flakes much easier.
